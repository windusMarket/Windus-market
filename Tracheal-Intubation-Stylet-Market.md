As hospitals and healthcare facilities continue to adopt newer technologies, the application of tracheal intubation stylets has broadened, leading to enhanced patient outcomes. The expanding geriatric population, marked by higher rates of chronic diseases, has further contributed to this upward trend. The market is expected to continue this momentum, with strong growth trajectories anticipated over the coming years.</p><p>Market research indicates that the global Tracheal Intubation Stylet market was valued at approximately $480 million in 2023.
